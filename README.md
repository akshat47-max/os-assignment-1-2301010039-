## Setup Instructions

### **1. Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Git installed (optional, if cloning the repo).
- Optional: VS Code for easy execution and viewing files.

---

### **2. Clone Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yashmalik2004/OS-assignment.git
cd "OS assignment"
```

### **2.1 Assignment 1: Process Creation and Management (OS_assignment1)**

- **File: process_management.py**
- **Output: output.txt**

**Steps to Run**
## **Windows**

- Open terminal or VS Code.

- Navigate to assignment folder:

```bash
cd OS_assignment1
```
- Run the script:
```bash
python process_management.py
```
- The program will execute all tasks and create/update output.txt in the same folder.

## **Linux**

- Open terminal.

- Navigate to assignment folder:
```bash
cd OS_assignment1
```

- Run the script:
```bash
python3 process_management.py
```
- Tasks like process creation, command execution, simulated zombie/orphan processes, and process info inspection will run.

- Output will also be saved in output.txt.

**Tasks Covered**

- Task 1: Process creation using Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing

- Task 2: Execute system commands using subprocess

- Task 3: Simulated zombie and orphan processes

- Task 4: Inspect current process info

- Task 5: Simulated process prioritization


### **2.2Assignment 2: System Startup Simulation (OS_assignment2)**

- **File: system_startup.py**
- **Output: process_log.txt**

**Steps to Run**
## **Windows**

- Open terminal or VS Code.

- Navigate to assignment folder:

```bash
cd OS_assignment2
```

- Run the script:

```bash
python system_startup.py
```

- Output logs of process start and end will be recorded in process_log.txt.

## **Linux**

- Open terminal.

- Navigate to assignment folder:
```bash
cd OS_assignment2
```

- Run the script:
```bash
python3 system_startup.py
```

- process_log.txt will contain timestamped logs of process execution.

**Tasks Covered**

- Sub-Task 1: Initialize logging for process events

- Sub-Task 2: Define dummy process tasks

- Sub-Task 3: Create and start multiple processes concurrently

- Sub-Task 4: Ensure proper termination and logging

## Notes

- Both scripts are cross-platform compatible.

- Make sure to have Python added to your system PATH.

- output.txt and process_log.txt files are auto-generated by the scripts.

- For Windows, use python command; for Linux, use python3.
